 I will sign up for GitHub copilot, And here are my period.and this is the first impression that I got.

And here are my period.this ifirst impression that I got

Next week. And to begin with a assumed that it would not work with Epix, which is proprietary to salesforce, but to my surprise, it did work pretty well. I tried to generate a test class for a batch of pics that I wrote. Although I did not get a chance to run the test class and see if that works, but it did generate a test script in Epix that makes sense Dot. I played around and try to generate snippets of cord at a specific length. Initially I asked to court" "" court court "" "Right. Go to get all opportunities forgiven account ID it did and the next thing I asked it to take the collection and put it in a map index by ID it just did that to end I asked it to see realize it and send it to available and call it, Jason string did it did that to and below are the screenshots of their generated snippets


So with that, I think it would be a pretty useful tool, which could save developers a lot of time when it comes to know the syntax off a new language or a feature. Imagine trying to visit stack, overflow and different website to get to the rights and tax and getting it to work by executing the code all that can be simplified to just asking the copilot to generate a piece of cord at this moment I'd like to stay on the positive side of using this tool.

One thing that I'm excited about is how it can save a lot of time for me and the dollar per one dollar pink, new features and especially paying out or writing new UA features on visual force pages and lightning the components.

I think the word
![alt text](image.png) #trigger it by clicking on the golden shiny star icon. y easy to understand a concept, rather than struggle with the syntax, and especially salesforce is pretty notorious for releasing you away technologies as you know, they have been subjects, and then there are visual fourth pages and then there are auto components, and then no, there is lightning web component, they seem to have settled down on LWC but we're not us.

I think it still needs the supervision of an engineer to verify what is being written, but I have seen no syntax errors, and the code that it give me will come by without any issues.

I will start using it as a Lumos as I create more classes and you were competent and will share more information and insights.

As an engineer, I recommend adopting this new wave off Off this disruptive technology.
I think that there will be a shift or change an expectation of the deliverables from engineers, but using this tool, we can adapt to using this technology to become more efficient and turn things around quicker.

I could see one possibility that the delineation between different programming languages will be will be will start to become will start to disappear as we can get the code generated in any given programming language, so the analytical skills of solving a business problem will become a priority rather than the syntax or a programming language that we are looking like I cannot in this blog post without talking about the possibility of elimination off job rules.

 But on the positive side, we will be saving some time, trying to write code and switch to different areas.
